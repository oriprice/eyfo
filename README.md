## Firefox Support
This extension can be run on Firefox, but it is not yet published in [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org).

Until it is published, you can build your own version and install it locally. It is actually quite simple - just follow these steps:
 
 To begin, you need to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed,
 and you need to have an account in [addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org).
 
 First, create credentials in [addons.mozilla.org credentials](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addon/api/key/).
 
 Now, clone this repo, open a command shell in its directory and run these commands:
 ```bash
npm install -g web-ext 
npm install
npm run build
cd dist
web-ext sign --api-key=$AMO_JWT_ISSUER --api-secret=$AMO_JWT_SECRET 
```

> Note: You need to replace `$AMO_JWT_ISSUER` and `$AMO_JWT_SECRET` with the credentials you created.

After these commands are executed, an **eyfo xpi file** is created under `dist/web-ext-artifacts`.
Now you can simply go to your Firefox and select **File -> Open File... (âŒ˜O)** and open this xpi file,
which will install it in your Firefox.

> Note: The shortcut used by **eyfo** to open its search window (`Ctrl+Shift+A` on Windows, `Command+Shift+A` on Mac)
is used by Firefox to open its add-ons page.
Until Firefox [enables users to customize add-ons keyboard shortcuts](https://www.ghacks.net/2019/01/16/manage-firefox-add-ons-keyboard-shortcuts-on-aboutaddons/),
if you want to have a keyboard shortcut for **eyfo**, you can edit the [src/manifest.json](blob/master/src/manifest.json) file
(before you build the plugin) and set the required shortcut under `commands._execute_browser_action.suggested_key`.
